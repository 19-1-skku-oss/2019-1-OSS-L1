## RUST

![Rust](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Rust_programming_language_black_logo.svg/240px-Rust_programming_language_black_logo.svg.png)

### Performance
Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.

### Reliability
Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — and enable you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time.

### Productivity
Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling — an integrated package manager and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and type inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.
